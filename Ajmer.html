                Ajmer is bustling city, located 130 km southwest of Jaipur and just 14 km from the pilgrimage town of
                Pushkar. The city of Ajmer gets its name from “Ajay Meru”, which can
                <br>be roughly translated as “invincible hill”. Home to a number of tourist places, Ajmer can be a
                perfect representation of the diversity of the Indian culture and ethics, and<br>
                displays a perfect blend of religion, community, culture, etc., coexisting and flourishing in
                harmony.<br>

                Ajmer remains a popular tourist attraction, in addition to being a pilgrimage centre for both Hindus and
                Muslims. The final resting place of the Sufi Saint, Khwaja Moinuddin
                <br> Hasan Chisti, is visited by Muslims from all over the world; in fact, the Dargah is revered equally
                by both Hindus and Muslims. The city is surrounded by the expansive lake <br>
                of Ana Sagar and the rugged hills of Aravalli. Although Ajmer Sharif Dargah, the shrine of Khwaja
                Muin-ud-din Chishti, remains as the most famous tourist places to visit in <br>

                Temple. Ajmer is also a well-known learning centre. The Mayo College <br>was one of India’s first
                schools that acted as the stepping stone for the British style of education and is now one of the
                popular places to visit in Ajmer.

                the defeat of Prithviraj Chauhan by <br>Mohammed Ghori, Ajmer become home to a number of dynasties. The
                Mughal Sultans particularly liked Ajmer due the presence of the holy Ajmer Sharif Dargah, the most
                <br>popular tourist place in the city. Ajmer has a rich history and played host to the first meeting
                between the Mughal King Jahangir and the Ambassador of the Court of King <br> James 1 of England, Sir
                Thomas Roe in 1616. The city was officially handed over to the British a few centuries later, making
                Ajmer the only region in Rajputana to be directly <br>controlled by the British East India Company.

                            <p>This is a Sufi shrine which encloses the ‘maqbara’ (grave) of Garib Nawaz, the Sufi saint
                                Khwaja Moinuddin Hasan Chishty. Built in the 13th century, the shrine is popular among
                                people of all faiths who flock here to have their prayers answered. The shrine has three
                                gates – the main gate or the Nizam gate, the Shah Jahan gate erected by the Mughal
                                Emperor and the Buland Darwaza. Another big draw at this holy shrine is the sacred and
                                scrumptious food that is served to devotees. Cooked in giant cauldrons known as ‘degs’,
                                devotees gather in throngs to be blessed by this prasad.</p>

                                later converted into a mosque by Sultan Ghori in 1198 AD. An impressive blend of
                                Indo-Islamic architecture, the structure was further beautified by Sultan Iltutmish in
                                1213 AD. Legend has it that the mosque is known as Adhai din ka Jhonpda (literally
                                meaning, The Hut of Two and a Half Days) because of a two and half day Urs of Panjab

                                named after Richard Bourke, the 6th Earl of Mayo, Mayo College was set up to provide the

                                College in Britain. John Lockwood Kipling, father of Nobel Laureate, Rudyard Kipling, as
                                principal of Mayo College, furnished the design of the Coat of Arms which shows a Rajput
                                and a Bhil warrior. The college building is one of the finest extant examples of

                                gives the lake its name. Many years later, Mughal Emperor Jahangir added his touch to
                                the lake by laying out the Daulat Bagh Gardens near the lake. Emperor Shah Jahan too,
                                contributed to the expansion by building five pavilions, known as the Baradari, between
                                the garden and the lake.</p>

                                and the marble staircase inside is engraved with images of the holy Tirthankars –
                                omniscient teachers of Jain faith who taught righteousness. Constructed in the late 19th
                                century, this temple is counted among the richest temples in India. Its main chamber,
                                Swarna Nagari (City of Gold), is aptly named so because of the several gold-plated
                                wooden figures it houses within its walls. This famous architectural marvel finds a
